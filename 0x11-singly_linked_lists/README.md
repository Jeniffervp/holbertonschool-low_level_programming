# 0x11-singly_linked_lists

## Linked list

A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.

Each record of a linked list is often called an 'element' or 'node'. A list is
comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node.
The last node has a reference to null. The entry point into a linked list is
called the head of the list. It should be noted that head is not a separate
node, but the reference to the first node. If the list is empty then the head is
 a null reference.

## Singly linked list

Singly linked lists contain nodes which have a data field as well as 'next' field,
 which points to the next node in line of nodes. Operations that can be performed
 on singly linked lists include insertion, deletion and traversal.
